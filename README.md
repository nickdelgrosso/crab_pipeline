# Animal Tracking Pipelines

Snakemake pipelines for processing videos of animals, in the lab, in the zoo, and in the field.

## Directory Structure

Code is arranged so that related pieces are as close to each other as possible (e.g. environment files are in the same directory as the scripts that use them, scripts for the same step are in the same step directory, steps are in the same directory as the pipeline that uses them, pipelines are all in the pipelines directory):


```

## Running Individual Pipelines

Generall, running the pipeline involves navigating to the pipeline's main directory and calling `snakemake` with the desired options.

Snakemake can be conda-installed or singularity installed.  Environment and recipe files can be found in the `tools/` directory.

For example, to get snakemake:
```
conda env create -n snakemake tools/snakemake/environment.yml
conda activate snakemake
```

To run a pipeline:
```
cd pipelines/pipeline_name
snakemake --cores 1 --use-conda
```

Details and configuration for individual pipelines should be found in that pipeline's directory.
